.. title: Saffran 1999 replication - weekly update (25.1)

----

Saffran et al. 1999
===================

*Statistical learning of tone sequences by human infants and adults*

Remi, Rishi, Emily, Luna, and Tom

----

A short reminder
================

- Statistical learning of tone sequences
- Similar performance to segmentation of syllable sequences into words

----

Since last week
===============

.. note::

  stimuli generation and assumptions. experiment design on another presentation

- we read the paper
- highlighted issues and assumptions
- generated the stimuli

----

A "tone story"
==============

.. note::

  words are given

- **Syllables:** pure tones
- **Words:** 3 syllables
- **Sentences:** 18 words
- **Story:** 24 sentences

In two languages.

----

Example
=======

Language 1 words

.. code::

  ADB DFE GG#A FCF# D#ED CC#D

For the listener they sound like

.. code::

  ADBDFEGG#AFCF#D#EDCC#D


----

How to combine words into sentences?
====================================

**Assumption 1:** Each word is present as many times as other words.

----

How to combine sentences into a story?
=======================================

**Assumption 2:** Each sentence is present as many times as other sentences.

----

The test
========

- 36 trials
- 2 words in each trial, one from each language
- Participants choose the more familiar word

----

Trials order
============

*"two different random orders of the test trials were generated and each was used to test half of the subjects."*

**Assumption 3:** Randomize the order of the words within each trial is randomized as well as the trials order.

----

Practice trials
===============

*"All subjects heard three practice trials prior to testing."*

**Assumption 4:** To avoid bias, practice trials use "fake" words.

----

----

Plans for next week
===================

- Gather documentation (consent form, test sheet, etc.)
- Apply for ethical approval
- Run a pilot study

----

Questions to you
================

- Using headphones instead of speakers?
- Choosing a room / changing rooms?
